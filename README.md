# NEScat


NEScat is an open-source web application where you can play singleplayer and multiplayer NES games.
      It is based on <a href="https://github.com/olahol">@olahol</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/olahol/melody-jsnes">olahol/melody-jsnes</a> project.
      I use the Go programming language and the Go HTTP Server. I also use the Go Melody framework. Multiplayer is done with WebSockets, JSNES is used to emulate the NES ROMS with JavaScript. Bootstrap is used for the frontend. I run the app on AWS EC2 Ubuntu Server 14.04.
      If you wish to contribute, use our code or look at how things are done feel free to head over to my GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/gg2001/NEScat">gg2001/NEScat</a>.
      Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/olahol">@olahol</a> for the original <a href="https://github.com/olahol/melody-jsnes">olahol/melody-jsnes</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/olahol/melody">olahol/melody</a> framework. Also many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bfirsh">@bfirsh</a> for creating the JavaScript NES Emulator, <a href="https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes">bfirsh/jsnes</a>.
      An Ionic iOS application is in the works, stay tuned for that!
